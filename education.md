Education

I am currently a senior at the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities pursuing a Mathematics B.S. and Computer Science minor, graduating May 2019. I am applying for Computer Science and Electrical & Computer Engineering M.S. programs starting Fall 2019. I am a first generation high school graduate and first generation undergraduate student. My goal is to be the first person in my family to attend graduate school.
