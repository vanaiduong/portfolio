**NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory** - Robotics Intern (Mars2020 & Innovation to Flight)

**Dates:** 05/2019 – 08/2019

**Project Name:** Voice Control for Mobility and Manipulation of Various Robotic Systems 

**Principal Objective:** Current interfaces for robotic control require human attention and intervention and lack the modalities for natural and efficient human expression. The principle objective of this research was to produce a multipurpose voice control system able to operate on various robotic systems such as simulated robotic environments, rovers, and drone swarms. Using Carnegie Mellon University’s PocketSphinx speech recognition project as a base and further implemented with machine learning and specialized dictionaries, key-lists, and language models, a grammatically flexible speech-to-text system was developed.

**Personal Task:** Implement voice-based interaction of human-robot mobility and manipulation commands of various single robots and robotic teams, including drones, space rover prototypes, and simulated interactive robotic environments and visualizations

**Language:** C 

**Hardware/Software Used:**

- Carnegie Mellon University’s PocketSphinx Speech Recognition Program
- Microsoft HoloLens

**NASA JPL’s Rover Sequencing and Visualization Program (RSVP):**

In collaboration with NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory’s Rover Sequencing and Visualization Program (RSVP) group, this speech-to-text system was implemented to expand high-level the rover mobility activity (macro) to the Rover Sequencing Editor (RoSE) and simulated with 3D graphics in HyperDrive. By connecting to JPL's RSVP system, these commands can further be sent to virtual reality simulations, testbed rovers, and rovers in space as well.

**Unmanned Air Vehicles (UAV) and Unmanned Ground Vehicles (UGV):**

In collaboration with NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory’s Innovation to Flight group, this speech-to-text system was implemented to be easily implemented into different kinds of robots including but not limited to Urban Air Vehicles (UAV) and Unmanned Ground Vehicles (UGV). A text-to-speech program was developed for verification and validation of commands.
