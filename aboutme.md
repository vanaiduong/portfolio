My name is Van Duong. I am a Senior at the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities pursuing a Mathematics B.S. and Computer Science minor. My expected graduation date is set to be May 2019.

- I rock a great mustache
- I'm extremely loyal to my family

What else do you need?

### my history

To be honest, I'm having some trouble remembering right now, so why don't you just watch [my movie](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Princess_Bride_%28film%29) and it will answer **all** your questions.
