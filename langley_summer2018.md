**NASA Langley Research Center** - NASA Academy Research Associate (NASA Leadership Program)

Dates: 05/2018 - 08/2018

- Worked in a multidisciplinary, diverse engineering team tasked to build a virtual reality Dell HTC Vive program using both Unity and X-Plane to integrate users into a piloting role for UAM flight

- Used online geographical databases to build virtual reality city environments and terrain based on real-world cities, and implemented weather for simulated emergency piloting events to aid in the research of UAM pilot behavior

- To maximize human-user interface, paired virtual reality with a 3D-printed aircraft control panel and mechanical flight simulator chair to fully immerse the user into a mixed-reality simulator booth
