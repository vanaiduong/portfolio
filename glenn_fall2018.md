**NASA Glenn Research Center** - Air Traffic Communication and Control Visualization Intern

**Dates:** 08/2018 â€“ 12/2018

**Research Project:** Air Traffic Communication and Control Visualization

**Role:** Co-Lead for Project

**Principle objective:** Urban Air Mobility (UAM) defines the safe and efficient air traffic operations in a metropolitan area for manned and unmanned aircraft systems. In order to address the communication and networking challenges UAM faces in a dense and congested city environment, a virtual reality visualization of UAM flight is being developed to run on multiple virtual reality platforms such as a Computer Automatic Virtual Environment (CAVE) and various head mounted displays. This interactive simulation will provide researchers, engineers, and policymakers the opportunity to simulate flight corridors and UAM radio communications of various UAM operations to increase understanding of UAM and its communication systems. This project was developed by NASA Glenn Research Center in an overall effort by the National Aviation and Space Administration to make UAM a safe and reliable method of transportation.

**Personal Tasks:**
- Acted as Lead Developer to produce a virtual reality (VR) Unity prototype of Urban Air Mobility (UAM) flight focused on addressing the challenges of air traffic communications and networking for congested flight paths, using multiple VR platforms such as Oculus Rift and Cave Automatic Virtual Environment (CAVE) system
- Designed a virtual urban testing environment and vehicle landing ports following Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) design requirements using 3D modeling software Esri and SketchUp, and built needed design tools with C# scripts
- Utilized radio range and performance data from GRC flight tests to accurately simulate wave reflection, diffraction, and shadowing to provide visualization for Federal Aviation Administration policymaking and engineering developments

**Language:** C#

**Hardware:** Computer Automatic Virtual Environment (CAVE) System, Oculus Rift Software: Unity, Esri CityEngine, Blender
